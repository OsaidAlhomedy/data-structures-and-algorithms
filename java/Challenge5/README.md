# Singly Linked List

<!-- Short summary or background information -->

Singly Linked Lists are a type of data structure where each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the list.

## Challenge

<!-- Description of the challenge -->

The challenge was to implement the linked list concept and methods manually without utilizing any built in classes.

## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

My implementation of the linked list includes the following algorithms:

- Insertion : this method takes in one argument which is the value to be inserted to the list.
  Time complexity : O(n)
  Space complexity : O(1)

- Includes : this method takes in one argument and transverse the list to find that find and returns true if it contains it and false if it does not.
  Time complexity : O(n)
  Space complexity : O(1)

- Overridden toString : this method overrides the default method and returns a string of the data within the list.
  Time complexity : O(n)
  Space complexity : O(n)

## API

<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->

- Insertion : this method takes in one argument which is the value to be inserted to the list.
- Includes : this method takes in one argument and transverse the list to find that find and returns true if it contains it and false if it.
- Overridden toString : this method overrides the default method and returns a string of the data within the list.
