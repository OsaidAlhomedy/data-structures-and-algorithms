# Stacks and Queues

<!-- Short summary or background information -->

A stack is a data structure consists of Nodes where each node reference the next node in the stack but does not reference its previous , a stack follows the rule First In Last Out (FILO)

A queue is a data structure consists of Nodes where it follows the rule First In First Out (FIFO)

## Challenge

<!-- Description of the challenge -->

In this challenge, we will be implementing stacks and queues data structure within java.

## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

All of the implemented methods are of O(1) time and space complexities.

## API

<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Stack and Queue-->

The methods I implemented are:

- Stacks

  - Push : this method adds a new stack.
  - Pop : this method removes a stack from the top of the stack.
  - Peek : this method returns the data from the top stack.
  - isEmpty : this method returns a boolean indicating whether the stack is empty or not.

- Queues

  - Enqueue : this method queues a new node.
  - Dequeue : this method removes a node from the front.
  - Peek : this method returns the data of the front queue.
  - isEmpty : this method returns a boolean indicating whether the queue is empty or not.
